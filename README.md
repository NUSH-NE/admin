# NE Admin

## About

The admin site of the NUSH NE website.

## Development

Make sure Yarn is installed globally before
running these commands: `npm i -g yarn`

Only tested on a Linux/macOS environment, should work on Windows
with the Windows-equivalent of these commands.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/NUSH-NE/admin.git`
2. `cd admin`
3. Start the dev server: `yarn start`

No dependency install required thanks to Yarn PnP!
